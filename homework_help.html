                    Look up the FAQs for most commonly asked that you may also have or chat with us on WhatsApp.<br><br>

                    <strong>What is homework help, and why do we need it?</strong><br>
                    To understand what homework help is, we first need to understand what homework is and why it is so
                    critical to our school or college education.<br><br>

                    Homework or assignment helps keep the students busy with their learning activities. After the
                    teaching is over, students need to practice it again, and then only they learn and understand
                    better. It helps teachers track the progress of their students. It gives parents a way to analyse
                    how their ward is doing in their academics.<br><br>

                    If the student does not do homework, their learning is compromised and hence to force the students
                    to do their homework, every school and college keep a certain percentage of the final grade for the
                    assignment. For example, it may have a weightage of 20%, final exam 50% and midterm exam 30%. By
                    spreading the marks, students focus shifts on all the parts. Just doing well in final exams or
                    midterms won’t help them achieve an A grade. As we can see very clearly in this case, if a student
                    does not pay attention throughout the semester and only focuses on the final exam, the maximum that
                    he can get is 50%! It is a failing mark in most schools and colleges of the USA, Canada, Kuwait,
                    UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc.<br><br>

                    If the student also focuses on the midterm, he can get an extra 30% making his grade 80%. It’s still
                    an average grade and not an outstanding one. So it’s very clear from this example that the 20%
                    weightage of homework, even though very low, still forces the students to do their homework
                    diligently. If they skip their homework, then they can get an average grade at best. To get an A
                    grade, they must do their homework regularly, which is the whole purpose of giving it- to keep the
                    students engaged in their studies and learning throughout the semester. Homework help is online
                    tutoring and online homework help service provided by online tutors. There is practically zero face
                    to face homework help these days.<br><br>

                    <b><strong>“Pay someone to do my homework”?</strong></b><br><br>
                    <b>1.Teacher giving too much homework </b> <br><br>
                    We understand that every teacher wants his students to learn as much as possible, but sometimes they
                    overboard and overdo it. We have come across a physics teacher who gives almost 50% of the textbook
                    questions as homework. They provide so much work that if the student does the homework entirely by
                    himself, there is no way to study other subjects. It is not a wise thing to put all your attention
                    on only one of the subjects. In such a case, it’s prudent to get the homework done by a homework
                    helper to balance all the subjects. Such homework helpers are the tutors of online tutoring and
                    homework help websites.<br><br>

                    <strong>2. Teacher giving complex questions</strong><br><br>
                    If the questions asked in the homework are extremely difficult or beyond the scope of the syllabus,
                    then it does not make much sense to waste a massive amount of time doing it. It’s better to learn
                    the basics and move on. Skipping it is the best thing to do, but if the weightage in the overall
                    grade is high, then there is no other option but to pay a homework helper to do the homework. We
                    have seen an HG maths tutor giving Cg level questions as homework.<br><br>

                    <strong>3.Personal or health issues</strong><br><br>
                    Of Course, you are a student, but before that, you are a human being. There are times when you fall
                    sick or have personal or family issues because you cannot focus on your studies. Many professors try
                    to accommodate such situations and give extra time to finish the homework or drop it altogether.
                    Some professors do not cooperate. A student has only two choices. Either he compromises with his
                    grade, or he gets the homework done by a homework helper. These days there is a massive disconnect
                    in social and personal relations. The professor sees the students as mere robots who have nothing to
                    do in his life except the studies. So when a student faces any health issue or personal or family
                    issue, the teacher is not ready to accept and behave as if the student is lying. Explaining the
                    situation does not help, and hence the homework help comes into the picture.<br>

                    Last month one student contacted us for online statistics homework because he got sick. We helped
                    him, and within a few weeks, he was back on track and started doing his homework himself.<br><br>

                    <strong>4. Inability to learn at the same pace</strong><br><br>
                    There are some genuine cases where the teacher teaches very fast, and the students cannot follow his
                    lectures. Sometimes students are slow learners, and they cannot follow the teacher even if the pace
                    of teaching is moderate. Whatever the reason is, the student finds himself in a spot of bother and
                    needs a helping hand. A homework helper comes to his rescue in such a case. This problem is more
                    profound in the case of mathematics and physics. It’s one of the reasons why we see so many online
                    homework help websites these days which provide homework help in math and homework help in
                    physics.<br><br>

                    One of our tutors shared a story of a student who was a Calculus topper in his college. He was
                    unable to understand organic chemistry. He took our help, and he managed to get good grades in
                    chemistry too. It helped him finish his chemistry homework, and slowly his chemistry knowledge also
                    improved.<br><br>

                    <strong>5. Not able to understand certain subjects</strong><br><br>
                    Sometimes the student is excellent in studies, and he does well in all the subjects except one or
                    two. One should not be too concerned about it. The wiring in our brains is different, and we may not
                    be good at everything we do. We at My Engineering Buddy have seen many cases where the student is
                    too good in maths and consistently scores an A+ in his school and college, but he struggles with
                    physics. It’s best to put more effort into the subject one finds difficult, but there is a limit
                    again. Grades in other subjects should not be affected by that. When there is a clear indication
                    that one cannot do well even after the best effort, it’s best to seek help from someone else. This
                    way, the overall grade (CGPA) is not affected.<br><br>

                    <strong>6. Working part-time to finance your education</strong><br><br>
                    Not all students come from a good financial background. It’s especially applicable to international
                    students. If a Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian or African student takes admission in the USA, it is
                    very costly for them, and their family cannot pay for his education 100%. In such a case, the
                    student works part-time in a restaurant, bar or a shop etc., to earn some extra money and reduce
                    their parent’s financial burden. They do part-time jobs, and it drains them out mentally and
                    physically. At times they find it challenging to do all their homework themselves. Of Course, paying
                    an online tutor or a homework helper to do their homework is not cheap, but it’s usually more
                    affordable than what they can earn by working part-time. It’s a trade-off, but it usually works most
                    of the time.<br><br>

                    <strong>7. Need for Faster and more efficient learning</strong><br><br>
                    Doing homework takes a lot of time, and even after that, there is no guarantee that you will learn
                    the subject well. But when you get help from a professional and expert homework helper from a
                    reputed site such as My Engineering Buddy, you save a lot of time and learn better and faster. Get
                    unstuck faster with our live homework help.<br><br>

                    <strong>8. Missed classes</strong><br><br>
                    If you missed some classes and could not follow the lectures from the notes provided, it’s better to
                    take help. It maintains your momentum, and you don’t lag in the class.<br><br>

                    <strong>9. Sheer laziness!</strong><br><br>
                    You did feel like doing the homework.<br><br>

                    If the answer to any of these questions is Yes, you need an online tutor who can help with homework.
                    (You can call these tutors homework helpers.)<br><br>

                    If it’s simply your laziness to do the homework, we suggest changing your ways and seeing if you can
                    improve.<br><br>

                    <strong>Is homework help ethical?</strong><br><br>
                    The short answer is Yes and No.<br><br>

                    Homework help is ethical if you take help in your homework with good intent. Learning better and
                    faster is a good intent. In this case, homework help is moral.<br><br>

                    If you have a valid reason for taking help in your homework, then also ethical. Some good reasons
                    can be<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Working part-time to finance your education</li>
                        <li>Not able to understand certain subjects</li>
                        <li>Teacher giving too much homework</li>
                        <li>Teacher giving complex questions</li>
                        <li>Personal or health issues</li>
                        <li>Need for Faster and more efficient learning</li>
                        <li>Inability to learn at the same pace</li>
                        <li>Missed classes</li>
                        <li>Personal or health issues</li>
                    </ul>
                    Being lazy is evil intent, and in this case, the homework help is unethical.<br><br>

                    So we see that the same homework help can be ethical or unethical depending upon the intent with
                    which you seek homework support. Clearly, “Homework help” itself is not moral or evil. It all
                    depends on the purpose and the situation under which you get it done.<br><br>
                    <hr>
                    <strong>What are the fees for online homework help/ homework help Online?</strong><br><br>
                    Online Homework help charges of a professional homework helper vary a lot. It mainly depends on the
                    nature of the assignment, Its complexity, time and effort needed to finish it, deadline etc. For an

                    </ul>
                    So we see that the fee can be anywhere from $2 to $20 for one question. Yes, it’s an extensive
                    range, and as said earlier, it all depends. It is to give you an idea about the fees charged. The
                    actual price is quoted only after looking at your assignment.<br><br>

                    The Tutor sees the questions. He makes a rough estimate of the time and effort needed. The fee
                    quoted is as per that. Usually, a tutor charges $30 for one hour of equivalent homework help
                    work.<br><br>

                    (Note: We at My Engineering Buddy follow the above rate chart, and our competitor’s also follows
                    something similar to this. All the fees mentioned are in USD.)<br><br>

                    teachers can give efficient homework assignments to the students, and hence every student gets an
                    equal opportunity to learn.<br><br>

                    <strong>Homework help in math</strong><br><br>
                    Maths or mathematics is the language in which science speaks. One can become better in science only
                    if one knows maths well. The brain is wired differently in the case of different individuals. Some
                    math comes naturally. To others, it isn’t easy. Unless one can visually see the numbers, it’s tough
                    to understand. If one is not good at numbers, then there is no way one can be good at maths.
                    Homework help in maths is an excellent assistance to such students. Maths has many topics.<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Algebra (Linear equations, Polynomials, Complex numbers, quadratic equations, graphs, conic
                            sections, logarithms, conic sections, permutations and combinations, probability, Arithmetic
                            and
                            geometric progression etc.)</li>
                        <li>Trigonometry</li>
                        <li>Geometry (Plain geometry, Coordinate geometry, 3D geometry or geometry of space)</li>
                        <li>Calculus (Calculus-1, Calculus-2, Calculus-3)</li>
                        <li>Differential equations etc</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some students are good at algebra, but they are not good at geometry. Some are good at geometry but
                    are not good at algebra. So we see that even within different topics of maths, students’ learning
                    abilities are different.<br><br>

                    Students who may need help with algebra homework may not need any help in geometry and vice versa.
                    At My Engineering Buddy, we understand this and provide homework help maths as per that.<br><br>

                    <strong>Homework help websites/websites for homework help</strong><br><br>
                    Apart from “Own Teacher”, you can get homework help at
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Chegg.com: It is suitable only for more straightforward questions. Chegg tutors skip
                            difficult
                            questions, so those who ask such questions are usually dissatisfied. Chegg subscribers can
                            get free
                            homework help ( just a few questions per month).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tutor.com: It is too costly. The tutors of tutor.com do not provide direct answers to
                            homework
                            questions. Instead, they explain the solutions. Although it’s a good way, it takes a
                            considerable
                            amount of time. Their service is suitable only for those students who need homework help
                            rarely. For
                            those who have a massive amount of homework questions, this site is not useful at all.

                    <strong>Do we also provide homework help for college?</strong><br><br>

                    Yes! We specialise in college homework help. All our tutors are highly qualified, and they can
                    handle homework questions of any level of difficulty and complexity.<br><br>
                    <hr>

                    <strong>Is our homework help free? Do we provide free homework help?</strong><br><br>
                    Unfortunately, we do not provide free homework help. We employ the best tutors, and they charge
                    reasonable fees. They never work for free, so we can’t provide any free homework help at all.
