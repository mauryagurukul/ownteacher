        <h4>
            Own Teacher is committed to providing top tutors who guarantee top grades in your homework
            assignments, lab reports, essay writing, and more. We also ensure a delightful experience in online tutoring
            sessions. A refund policy is an essential feature of online homework help and tutoring service; this page
            will provide you with more details about the same.<br><br>

            We have many checks and balances to honor our promise and deliver excellent tutoring services.<br><br>

            In the last 5 years, we have received a request for a refund in only 0.58% of the cases. Such is the
            quality of our services: less than 1 out of 100 students ever demand a refund!<br><br>

            We value our customers, so we have a clear-cut refund policy.<br><br>

            <strong>Cancellations</strong> <br>
            After making the payment for online tutoring and homework help, if you want to cancel for some reason, we
            allow you to do so.<br>
            To cancel, please get in touch with us on WhatsApp and depending upon the proximity of the deadline or
            appointment time, we will keep part of the fee and refund the rest.
            For tutoring sessions, you can cancel 24 hours before without any charges. If the time is less than 24 hours
            but greater than 2 hours, then a 10% fee will be deducted. For less than 2 hours, we will deduct 20% of the
            fee paid. If the session time has already approached, we will not be able to refund any fee.
            For homework/assignments, we refund the fee as per the work already done by the tutor. If the tutor has,
            say, done 30% of the work already, we will keep the 30% fee and refund the 70% back. So we advise you to
            contact us as soon as possible.<br><br>

            <strong>Amount of Refund</strong><br>
            We refund your fee partially or fully, depending upon the nature of the dispute. We often give “credits,”
            equivalent to “money” that you can use to pay for future tutoring and homework help services.<br><br>

            <strong>How to raise a refund request?</strong><br>
            If you are dissatisfied with the quality of our service, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us on our
            student helpline team on WhatsApp and tell us your concern. We will discuss the issue with our tutors and
            management and will contact you back with the resolution within a week. We usually resolve all disputes
            within 2-3 days and sometimes minutes. But we assure you that we will resolve your dispute within a
            week.<br><br>

            <strong>How much time does it takes for the money to reach your account once we issue a refund?</strong><br>
            The refund is instantly reflected in your PayPal account if you paid via PayPal. We share a screenshot of
            the refund, which contains the transaction ID for the refund, so that you can follow up with PayPal for the
            same. The money may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to reach your credit card or bank account.
            It depends on your bank and credit card, and we have no control over it.<br><br>

            From our side, the money is deducted from our PayPal account as soon as the refund is processed. PayPal also
            refunds it instantly to your PayPal account, but the banks and credit card companies take a considerable
            time to process these refunds.<br><br>

            If you paid directly via a credit card, though, we would share a screenshot of the refund, and it may take
            anywhere from a few days to a few weeks for the refund to reflect in your account. For this reason, we
            suggest our clients pay via PayPal.<br><br>

            <strong>Where does the refund go?</strong><br>
            The refund goes back to the “SAME” source where it came from. There are tax-related and legal difficulties
            in sending the refund to any “OTHER” account. So in case you cannot receive the refund in the same account
            for any reason, we can give you a “Credit,” which you can use to pay for future services. You can also share
            that credit with your friends and family, and they can use those credits to pay for our services.<br><br>

            Under no circumstances will we be able to refund your money to any other account.<br><br>

            <strong>How do we handle refund requests?</strong><br>
            We have a grievance redressal team comprising our top management, which looks after the students’
            complaints, tutor’s complaints, suggestions, disputes, refunds, credits, etc. This team acts as a gardener
            who cleans the garden daily, removing weeds and unwanted plants, so the garden always looks good.<br><br>

            So the refund request is handled by our top management to ensure that we take the best action
            possible.<br><br>

            Once you raise a refund request, we share the details with the concerned tutor and the grievance redressal
            team. Both check the history of the disputed session (homework help or online tutoring) and try to conclude.
            Occasionally, our grievance team may ask you to provide more information over chat or call.<br><br>

            The grievance redressal teams make the final call and decide the case in a way that keeps our students and
            tutors happy. Sometimes we take the loss instead of passing it on to the tutor or the student. Mostly, we
            decide the case in favor of the student because we consider the customer as God.<br><br>

            Like all the other systems, our system is not perfect, but we try our best to do justice with each refund
            request raised. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the refund request, you can reach our founder
            at skp10092001@gmail.com.<br><br>
